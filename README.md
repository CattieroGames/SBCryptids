## Skrolos

**Skrolos** are the first cryptids and the creators of every single other cryptid. They appear to have some sort of "leader", although the only currently known thing about him is that he goes by **"Lord Skrolo"**. They are widely considered to be the most evil cryptids among the Cryptology Community, although some of their creations have rebelled against their malevolent ways, most famously **The Goongalar**.  
  
Their appearance is similar to that of a cloud, though they appear to have eyes and a mouth. It is currently unknown whether or not those organs serve any purpose to them. It's unknown if this is their only state.   
  
```plaintext
Do NOT be fooled by their rather "cute" appearance.   
They have been known to be vicious and relentless in their attacks, ESPECIALLY in large numbers.
```

The first *currently* known spotting of it was in the Daycare area, in the famous "Five Nights of Freddy's" photograph taken by famous Cryptogropher **Cybo**.

## The Goongalar

**The Goongalar** is one of The Originals and one of the few who oppose the malevolent teachings of **Lord Skrolo**. Not much is known about it other than that.
